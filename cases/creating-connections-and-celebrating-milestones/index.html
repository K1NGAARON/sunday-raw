                HubSpot, one of the world's leading CRM and marketing automation platforms, is renowned not only for its innovative software but also for its commitment to employee well-being and satisfaction. To reinforce its culture and celebrate key moments in its employees' journeys, HubSpot partnered with Sunday to create and distribute premium, on-brand merchandise. This case study explores how this collaboration has strengthened employee connection and highlights the lessons other companies can learn from this successful partnership.

                1. Enhancing employee connection through thoughtful gifting
            </h2>
            <p>
                HubSpot's collaboration with Sunday focused on several key projects aimed at celebrating important milestones for their Customer Success Management (CSM) team:
                <br><br>
                <span class="bold">Week of Rest Campaigns:</span> To encourage relaxation during HubSpot's annual Week of Rest, Sunday created customized gift boxes, including items like branded sliders, blankets, and cozy socks. These thoughtful gifts not only provided comfort but also reinforced HubSpot's commitment to the well-being of its employees.

            <p>
                <span class="bold">End of Year Gifts:</span> At the end of each year, HubSpot employees received custom-branded t-shirts and other items packaged in beautifully designed boxes, creating a memorable unboxing experience that emphasized quality and care.
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="bold">Baby Campaigns:</span> New parents were celebrated with a personalized baby box, featuring a beanie and baby bodysuit, along with a custom thank-you card. This gesture extended HubSpot's culture of care to both employees and their families.
                <br><br>
                <span class="bold">Tenure Celebrations:</span> Employees celebrating their three-year and five-year anniversaries received premium merchandise, including hoodies, socks, and weekend bags, all packaged with custom-branded silk paper and thoughtful messaging.

                2. Customization and personalization: A fully on-brand experience
            </h2>
            <p>
                Every aspect of the merchandise, from the recycled boxes to the personalized thank-you cards, was meticulously designed to align with HubSpot's brand identity:
                <br><br>
                <span class="bold">On-brand design:</span> The merchandise featured HubSpot's signature orange, and even the smallest details, like the sticker holding the silk paper together, were customized to reflect the company's branding.
                <br><br>
                <span class="bold">Unboxing experience:</span> The carefully curated unboxing experience made each gift feel special, reinforcing the value HubSpot places on its employees and ensuring that the merchandise was not just received but appreciated.

                3. Seamless logistics and EMEA Distribution
            </h2>
            <p>
                One of the major challenges for a global company like HubSpot is ensuring that every employee, regardless of location, receives their merchandise on time:
                <br><br>
                <span class="bold">Effortless Coordination:</span> HubSpot provided Sunday with a list of employees, including their sizes and locations, and Sunday handled the rest. The Wardrobe platform facilitated global shipping, customs clearance, and tracking, ensuring that every package was delivered within the specified timeframe, even for large-scale campaigns like the Week of Rest.
                <br><br>
                <span class="bold">Outsourced Logistics:</span> By outsourcing the logistics to Sunday, HubSpot was able to focus on their core business while ensuring a smooth and efficient distribution process, something that would have been nearly impossible to manage internally.
            </p>
            <img src="./img/image-5.png" alt="">
            <p class="italic">Operational excellence in Europe
                <br><br>
                By localizing the production and fulfillment process within Europe, we were able to reduce HubSpot's shipping costs by 90% and cut delivery times from three weeks to just two to three days. This not only made the process more efficient but also more sustainable, as packages no longer needed to travel across the globe.

            </h2>
            <p>
                HubSpot's approach to employee engagement through merchandise offers valuable insights for other companies:
                <br><br>
                <span class="bold">Focus on key moments:</span> Identify significant moments in the employee journey and invest in high-quality, on-brand merchandise to celebrate them.
                <br><br>
                <span class="bold">Streamline processes:</span> Use a platform like Sunday's Wardrobe to automate and manage the logistics of merchandise distribution, ensuring consistency and efficiency.
                <br><br>
                <span class="bold">Tell a story:</span> Ensure that each gift is accompanied by a narrative that reinforces the company's values and the reason behind the gift, enhancing its impact.
                <br><br>
                <span class="bold">Sustainability matters:</span> Consider the environmental impact of your merchandise and packaging. HubSpot's commitment to sustainability was reflected in their choice of recycled materials and carbon offsetting practices.
