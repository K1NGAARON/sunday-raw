                In the world of luxury hypercars, where every detail matters, Bugatti Rimac has set a new standard for automotive excellence. Born from the merger of Bugatti, the legendary sports car manufacturer, and Rimac Automobili, an innovative leader in electric hypercar technology, Bugatti Rimac represents the pinnacle of high-performance engineering and design. As part of their strategy to reinforce their brand's prestige and connect with their elite clientele, Bugatti Rimac collaborated with Sunday to create bespoke merchandise that reflects the same level of craftsmanship and attention to detail found in their vehicles.
                <br><br>
                This case study highlights two key initiatives: the creation of hyper-custom raincoats as top-tier gifts for key prospects and the development of a meticulously designed merchandise collection for the launch of the Rimac Nevera Time Attack—a limited edition car with only ten units produced.

            <h2>
                The challenge
            </h2>
            <p>
                Bugatti Rimac needed merchandise that would not only resonate with their discerning customer base but also align with the brand's ethos of luxury, exclusivity, and cutting-edge technology. The merchandise had to serve multiple purposes, including:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    Impressing key prospects at major car fairs and events with high-end, memorable gifts.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Celebrating the launch of the Rimac Nevera Time Attack by offering fans and customers exclusive, beautifully designed merchandise that mirrors the car's uniqueness.

                Hyper-custom raincoats: premium gifts for key prospects
            </h2>
            <p>
                To capture the attention of potential car buyers at high-profile events, Bugatti Rimac commissioned Sunday to design and produce hyper-custom raincoats. These were no ordinary raincoats; they were meticulously crafted to embody the luxury and exclusivity of the Bugatti Rimac brand.

            <p>
                <span class="bold">The bespoke design:</span> Every detail of the raincoats was carefully considered, from the subtle yet distinctive branding to the custom packaging that echoed the experience of unboxing a Bugatti or Rimac vehicle. The design needed to be subtle at first glance, with the black raincoat offering a sleek and minimal appearance. However, the details were meticulously branded: the zipper was crafted in a distinctive “racing green” and engraved with their logo, each button featured the Rimac icon, and the inner lining showcased a luxurious pattern of the logo. The interior labels were beautifully woven to exude a sense of true luxury.

                <span class="bold">Exclusive distribution:</span> These raincoats were not available for purchase. They were handed out personally to select prospects at major car fairs, making them a coveted item that further elevated the brand’s exclusivity.
                <br><br>
                <span class="bold">Impact:</span> The raincoats were a massive success, creating a lasting impression on potential customers and reinforcing Bugatti Rimac's commitment to excellence. This initiative not only enhanced brand visibility at key events but also deepened the emotional connection between the brand and its elite audience.
