                In the competitive world of remote access software, AnyDesk stands out as a fast-growing leader, known for its innovative solutions and global reach. However, the company recognized early on that to sustain its rapid growth and strengthen its market position, it needed more than just a great product. Building strong relationships with its resellers and dealers, who play a critical role in influencing purchasing decisions, became a strategic priority. To achieve this, AnyDesk turned to Sunday to create and execute a comprehensive merchandise strategy designed to transform these key partners into loyal brand ambassadors.

            <h2>
                The core challenge: Engaging and retaining resellers in a competitive software market
            </h2>
            <p>
                For AnyDesk, the reseller and dealer network is a vital part of its distribution strategy. These partners are often the primary influencers when it comes to recommending software solutions to end-users, especially in markets where direct sales are less prevalent. In a crowded marketplace with numerous competitors, ensuring that these resellers and dealers prefer AnyDesk over other options is crucial. However, fostering this loyalty among hundreds of partners worldwide posed significant challenges:
                <br><br>
                <span class="bold">Influence on decision-making:</span> Resellers and dealers have a strong influence on the purchasing decisions of their clients. AnyDesk needed to ensure that these partners not only knew about their product but actively recommended it over competitors.
                <br>
                <span class="bold">Brand ambassadorship:</span> Turning resellers into brand ambassadors who genuinely believe in and promote AnyDesk required more than just product knowledge; it needed a personal connection to the brand.
                <br>
                <span class="bold">Scalability:</span> With hundreds of resellers across different regions, AnyDesk needed a scalable solution that could consistently engage partners while also being manageable.

                The strategic solution: A multi-phase loyalty program with merchandise at its core
            </h2>
            <p>
                To address these challenges, AnyDesk partnered with Sunday to design and roll out a multi-phase loyalty and activation program centered around strategic merchandise. This program was tailored to gradually build strong relationships with resellers, transforming them from mere distributors into enthusiastic advocates for AnyDesk.

            <h3>
                1. Welcome packages: The first touchpoint
            </h3>
            <p>
                The program began with the distribution of welcome packages to hundreds of resellers worldwide. These packages were carefully curated to include high-quality, branded merchandise that would make a strong first impression. The goal was to introduce resellers to the AnyDesk brand in a way that felt personal and premium, setting the tone for a deeper partnership.
                <br><br>
                <span class="bold">Strategic selection:</span> The merchandise in the welcome packages was chosen to resonate with IT professionals, ensuring it was both useful and desirable.
                <br>
                <span class="bold">Global distribution:</span> Sunday managed the complex logistics of shipping these packages to resellers across different regions, ensuring timely delivery and consistency in the experience.

            <h3>
                2. Ongoing engagement and feedback
            </h3>
            <p>
                After the initial welcome package, Sunday continued to engage with resellers to gather feedback and ensure they were satisfied with their AnyDesk experience. This step was critical in not only maintaining the relationship but also in understanding how the merchandise and the brand were being perceived by the resellers.
                <br><br>
                <span class="bold">Follow-up communication:</span> Sunday facilitated follow-up communications to check if the resellers had received their packages and to gauge their reactions.
                <br>
                <span class="bold">Feedback loops:</span> The insights gathered from these interactions were used to refine the program and ensure it was meeting the needs of the resellers.
            </p>

            <h3>
                3. Building loyalty through continuous merchandise activations
            </h3>
            <p>
                The program was designed to be scalable, with the ability to expand and deepen the relationship over time. Resellers were given opportunities to earn more AnyDesk merchandise through their ongoing partnership, turning the merchandise into a tangible reward system that reinforced their loyalty.
                <br><br>
                <span class="bold">Merchandise tiers:</span> As resellers achieved certain milestones or participated in specific activities, they could earn additional branded items, creating a sense of progression and exclusivity.
                <br>
                <span class="bold">Ongoing programs:</span> Sunday managed the logistics of these ongoing programs, ensuring that resellers continued to receive merchandise that reinforced their connection to the AnyDesk brand.

            </h3>
            <p>
                Given the scale and complexity of the program, AnyDesk needed a partner who could handle the entire process—from design and production to distribution and feedback collection. Sunday's expertise in executing large-scale merchandise campaigns made them the ideal partner for this initiative.
                <br><br>
