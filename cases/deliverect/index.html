            Deliverect, the ‘Adyen of food delivery services’ grew 750% in the last year. A boost that also sent the number of employees skyrocketing. By managing their employee onboarding kits, Sunday helped create an authentic company culture.

                Deliverect: connects third-party delivery platforms and food businesses around the globe.
            </p>
            <p>
                Deliverect integrates third-party food ordering platforms into the restaurant’s point-of-sale system, making rekeying orders and the costly errors that come with it a thing of the past. With all online orders centrally managed, businesses can increase operational efficiency, which will ramp up customer satisfaction. With the celebration of 5 million orders they called upon Sunday. 
                <br><br>
                Because mutual respect is one of their pillars, they like to celebrate their achievements with the whole team and thank them for their efforts resulting in a big success. Their first contact with company fashion had to be with an experienced team. That’s why Sunday designed company fashion for Deliverect as a celebration for their first milestone and as a thank you for their employee’s hard work. For their first fashion collection they wanted a simpel, but classic design. We created a full coloured box filled with a branded hoodie, socks, mouth mask and a dopper bottle.  At Sunday we offer high quality company fashion produced in a sustainable way, so we could easily meet the company's requirements.
                <br><br>
                A second challenge Deliverect endured was onboarding. Due to Covid-19, the explosive rise of online food delivery has forced restaurants to change how they operate. So Deliverect kept on growing, the company processed about $1 billion across 30 million orders for its customers. That's up sixfold since their previous fashion collection for their first milestone. With business growing almost 750% in the last year, Deliverect needed to expand their team and fast. As they want to create an authentic company culture, the first thing on their list was managing their employee onboarding kits.

                Uniform onboarding boxes
            </h2>
            <p>
                Being able to reward customers with branded gifts gives them a feeling of importance. But by giving them an onboarding box filled with company fashion they made new employees immediately part of their culture. After their first touch with company fashion Deliverect was convinced they needed wearables for their second challenge. A great onboarding package can tackle all these worries and create the perfect start for a solid onboarding process. As they are ambitious and innovative, they hire 10 new employees every week and so 10 new possible ambassadors. The Belgian company is a fast booming business, so building ambassadorship is a priority in their revenue generation plan. But they do want to handle with a personal approach:

                    “No one is a number here; even if we will have 300 employees by 2021. Everyone's opinion counts, and things like team spirit and collaboration will always be high on our list of priorities", says Jan Hollez, co-founder and CTO.

        <div class="container">
            <p>
                And to make an onboarding process successful, it has to be uniform for everyone in the company. That’s why we created personalized boxes again, but now focussed on their onboarding process for their 11 different offices. The box was filled with a hoodie, a T-shirt, socks and a thermos flask. This time, they wanted to reduce the use of plastic, so they chose a bottle made of metal instead of the dopper bottle made of plastic in the first box. Since they were over the moon with their last branded items, they wanted to continue the line in this collection by working with space references in the design.

                From Ghent to Sydney
            </h2>
            <p>
                Deliverect started with 100 onboarding boxes. Yet these boxes needed to be sent around the globe. Because of their offices in Ghent, London, Madrid, New York, Paris, Dubai, Toronto, Edinburgh, Amersfoort, Sydney and recently an expansion with offices in Mexico, Uruguay and Kyrgyzstan they were in need of an international solution. Even though they help businesses manage their food delivery and takeout operations more efficiently, they are not a delivery provider.
                <br><br>
                That’s why they were immediately on board of our SaaS-platform the Sunday Wardrobe™. Through our platform we made it super easy for Deliverect to warehouse, handle and ship the boxes to their new hires all over the world. Not only did we take away the struggle of logistics and shippings, by grouping all the efforts related to clothing instead of having tonnes of shredded initiatives, Deliverect saved up to 50% per year in costs. Sending more than 250 onboarding boxes to specific addresses of their employees, means we were able to plant 6 trees in The Amazon rainforest.

                To infinity and beyond
            </h2>
            <p>
                Company fashion is the guide to becoming real brand ambassadors. A statement Deliverect was only totally convinced of after receiving their first fashion collection. Not only did the quality of our products do the magic, seeing positive outcomes did the real trick.  Even in the offices, there was a lot of buzz around the fashion wearables, as well since current employees also wanted an onboarding box. Resulting in increased employee loyalty and ambassadorship by making that first day an awesome experience.
                <br><br>
                Because of their intensive use of the Sunday Wardrobe, we were able to keep improving our platform. Out of the feedback, we could update with new automations and add a chat function to give complete transparency and the ability to talk with one of our Sunday Wardrobe™ experts. Because at Sunday we offer a made-to-measure way and a relationship that is human-first. 
                <br><br>
                As we start each project by mapping out the exact strategic needs and specific demands, we came up with a plan of action that catered to the exact needs of Deliverect. Imagine the platform as their virtual wardrobe, consisting of different closets. One of their main concerns was the access to the closets of multiple managers and departments responsible in the various countries. So we made sure that the people with access to the different closets could build campaigns, using the items that are available in their respective closets. Having different offices, we also made sure they only use items that are 100% consistent and on brand. Challenge succeeded with a glance! The future promises 700-800 new onboarding boxes and lots of new fashion projects.
