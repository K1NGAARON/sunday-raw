Oaky's collection includes hoodies, sweaters and socks and definitely can't be missed with its vibrant purple color. For the design we used Oaky's corporate colors: a combination of purple, white and orange. Eventually the collection is not only being used for employer branding, check the full case to see what other challenges we helped Oaky unlock.

                Oaky's team consists of experts in hospitality and tech from all over the world full with innovative ideas and new initiatives. One of the ideas being to enter the world of company fashion. As Oaky's marketing team was setting up a huge marketing campaign to invest more in their visibility and image as an employer. And thereby implement an employer branding strategy.
                <br><br>
                Employer branding has become a buzzword within most organisations over the last year. Yet only 56% of employers have an employer branding strategy in place. Oaky realised that the external values and ethics they advertise on behalf of the company, needed to be believed and resonated by their employees. Since Oaky was convinced that investing in company fashion would boost their internal culture, Sunday made every effort to involve employees in promoting the brand values both internally and externally.

                It is the role of a company's marketing department to deliver consistent brand messages to all external stakeholders. Marketing should have a thorough understanding of a company's brand, what it means and how it should be communicated. That's why our designers were constantly in contact with their marketeers to have a better understanding of how the brand wanted to be perceived internally and externally. 
                <br><br>
                As a brand needs to start from the inside out, our team delved deep to discover Oaky's greatest treasures. We created a company fashion collection that is 100% on brand. The collection included hoodies, sweaters and socks produced in their vibrant purple color in combination with white and orange. A subtle pattern breaks the purple base and is finished off with orange strings. Because Oaky's stakeholders loved every piece, they even used the collection as part of a huge give-away. Because what's not to love?

                Numerous challenges tackled
            </h2>
            <p>
                In the end, the collection was not only used for their employer branding strategy and internal and external giveaway, Oaky implemented their branded fashion collection to increase brand awareness and to build an onboarding strategy. That's tackling five challenges in one fell swoop using just one collection! 
                <br><br>
                Since company culture became a very important issue to tackle for Oaky, Sunday really helped to lock in the internal influencers and champions inside. Next to developing skills and knowledge, the employees are guided to become real brand ambassadors. Their challenges are gradually becoming a big success and they are only using company fashion for the first time this year.
                <br><br>
                Company fashion is an investment for the long term success and ongoing engagement of your employees. A statement Oaky is 100% aligned with. The Dutch company reordered the collection since they keep on growing fast. With these important challenges we could help tick off for them, they named us as their solid partner for company fashion. As we are currently speaking, we are creating an Oaky branded Spring collection. We can't wait for SS22!
