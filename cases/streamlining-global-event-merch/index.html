                In the rapidly evolving tech landscape, few companies have experienced growth as explosive as Deel. As a global leader in payroll services, Deel enables companies to hire talent from anywhere in the world, a capability that has propelled it to unicorn status and set the stage for an upcoming IPO. This extraordinary growth is mirrored in the sheer number of events Deel hosts annuallyâ€”over 400 to 500 events spanning every continent. These range from small customer gatherings to major exhibitions, making merchandise a key element in building brand loyalty and engagement.

                The challenge: Fragmented merchandise management amidst rapid growth
            </h2>
            <p>
                Before partnering with Sunday, Deel faced significant challenges in managing their merchandise needs across these numerous events. With every event requiring a new set of merchandise, Deel found itself working with dozens of different suppliers each year, leading to a host of issues:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <span class="bold">Inconsistent quality:</span> With different vendors supplying items for each event, the quality of merchandise varied greatly, leading to complaints and dissatisfaction.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="bold">High costs:</span> The need for urgent production and last-minute orders often resulted in exorbitant costs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="bold">Logistical nightmares:</span> Shipping delays, customs issues, and frequent delivery failures created stress and disrupted the smooth execution of events.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="bold">Inefficiency:</span> Repeated vendor onboarding and management for each event consumed valuable time and resources, distracting Deel from focusing on its core business.

            </div>
            <p>
                To address these challenges, Deel partnered with Sunday to take a step back and reevaluate their entire merchandise process. Together, they implemented a centralized approach that streamlined operations, reduced costs, and ensured consistent quality across the globe.

            <h3>
                1. Forecasting and centralized production
            </h3>
            <p>
                Sunday began by working closely with Deel to forecast their merchandise needs for a six-month period. By understanding the events planned and the expected demand, Sunday was able to produce merchandise in large batches, significantly reducing the per-unit cost. This centralized production approach not only ensured that Deel received premium items at a reduced cost but also eliminated the inefficiencies of dealing with multiple vendors.
            </p>

            <h3>
                2. Global consistency
            </h3>
            <p>
                One of Deel's key requirements was consistency. They wanted to offer the same high-quality, premium merchandise at every event, regardless of location. Sunday developed a comprehensive collection for Deel that included tennis socks, zipped hoodies, sweaters, T-shirts, picnic blankets, water bottles, and tea bottlesâ€”each item designed to resonate with Deel's brand identity. This collection was standardized across all regions, ensuring that whether an event was in EMEA, Latin America, the USA, or Asia, attendees would receive the same top-tier merchandise.

                3. Just-In-Time delivery and logistics management
            </h3>
            <p>
                With centralized production, Sunday took on the responsibility of storing the merchandise and managing the complex logistics of global distribution. By handling customs, shipping, and last-mile delivery, Sunday ensured that the merchandise arrived just in time for each event, freeing Deel from the logistical burdens that had previously plagued their operations. This approach allowed Deel to focus on the events themselves, confident that the merchandise would be there when needed.

            <p>
                Centralizing their merchandise strategy with Sunday led to substantial cost savings for Deelâ€”over 40% reduction in product costs compared to their previous decentralized approach. By eliminating the need for urgent, last-minute orders and leveraging bulk production, Deel was able to optimize their budget without compromising on quality.

                    <span class="bold">Internal employee shop:</span> As Deel scaled, the need for an internal merchandise solution became apparent. Sunday is now in the process of setting up an employee shop, complete with a coin system that allows Deel's 5,000 remote employees worldwide to order branded merchandise.
