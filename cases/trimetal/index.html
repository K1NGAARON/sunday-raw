                AkzoNobel operates as a paints and coatings company worldwide. It offers decorative paints, including paints, lacquers, and varnishes; a range of mixing machines and color concepts for the building and renovation industry. One of their brands is Trimetal.
                <br><br>
                Trimetal's main market are professional painters. They purchase their paint from dealers who sell various brands, including Trimetal. Even though the ultimate end customer is the proprietary/client, it will be the painter who will make a proposal of the paint brand. He will base this choice mainly on the quality of the paint, the products he himself prefers to work with and which he knows can deliver a good result. The painter is therefore the decision maker and a very important profile for Trimetal.

            <h2>
                Targeted marketing for the right audience
            </h2>
            <p>
                Obviously, then, Trimetal would prefer to know who the painters are who purchase their products from the dealers. If they have this data it becomes much easier to undertake targeted marketing actions such as, for example, informing them of new products in the range, renewals or improvements in products, ... so that they are sure to remain loyal to the brand.
                <br><br>
                The problem here is that Trimetal has no record of who the painters are who purchase their products. They see which dealer sells how much of their brand but have no idea to whom. So, on the one hand, they are dependent on the dealer, from whom they want their brand to be especially prominent, and on the other, they have to hope that painters remain loyal to the Trimetal brand.
                <br><br>
                In general suppliers and dealerships must work together effectively to ensure that products are marketed and sold successfully. Communication breakdowns and lack of collaboration can lead to missed sales opportunities or customer satisfaction issues.

            <h2>
                Dealer management challenges
            </h2>
            <p>
                The challenge for Trimetal in this situation is threefold: 
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    How can we get painters to become even better ambassadors?
                </li>
                <li>
                    How can we increase our sales?
                </li>
                <li>
                    Who are the professional painters and can we target them directly?
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                With Sunday we wanted to help Trimetal to tackle these challenges as efficiently as possible. To be clear, it has never been Trimetal's intention to exclude dealers or minimize their role. They are still very important and remain the ultimate distributor of Trimetal products. The ideal solution boosts both dealer sales and generates data for Trimetal.
            </p>
        </div>

        <img src="./img/image2.jpg" alt="Trimetal company fashion">

        <div class="container">
            <h2>
                Trimetal webshop as a data capture system
            </h2>
            <p>
                The solution consisted of several actions that could all be linked to a Trimetal web shop with their branded apparel.
                <br><br>
                The first part of the solution consisted of giving the dealer a promotional discount. A discount was given when purchasing a certain amount of Trimetal products. The dealers could then start playing this discount themselves in their stores to attract even more painters to their stores. 
                <br><br>
                Every professional painter who purchased a certain amount of Trimetal paint was given a coupon code along with the link to the Trimetal web shop. On that webshop, they could choose a branded clothing item for free. To do so, they had to enter some information including name and email address. In this way, Trimetal could quickly generate a lot of data and suddenly had the opportunity to approach their end customers directly with marketing messages. 
                <br><br>
                The painters had a choice between quality t-shirts, caps, a sweater and cycling apparel in the typical Trimetal colors.  All items can easily be worn as casual wear outside working hours and because of the premium quality, contemporary designs and modern fit, they are items that are actually happy to be worn which in itself provides extra visibility but is also perceived as a valuable gift by the painter.
                <br><br>
                This campaign ensured that all parties benefited from the action taken: the dealer had a nice promotion with which to excel, the painter was rewarded with a nice clothing item for his purchases and Trimetal generated data and managed to give their customers even more visibility as ambassadors.
                <br><br>
