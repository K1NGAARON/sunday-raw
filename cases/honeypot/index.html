                Honeypot: a developer-focused job platform.
            </p>
            <p>
                Honeypot is dedicated to Tech Recruiting, their mission is to get every developer a great job. They believe developers should have all the information they need to choose a job they love: whether that’s based on a cutting-edge tech stack, an inspiring team or just good old-fashioned salary. Today, Honeypot is Europe’s leading developer-focused job platform, serving Germany and the Netherlands. As the more than 1,000 talents are the driving force behind the platform, they are Honeypot's priority.
                <br><br>
                A positive customer experience is crucial to the success of their business, because a happy customer is one who is likely to become a loyal customer who can help boost revenue. Being able to reward these talents with a unique personalized gift shows current clients that they are greatly appreciated, creating a positive association with your company and gives them a feeling of importance. Certainly since Honeypot mainly offers services instead of products.

                Keeping the bees happy with quality gifting
            </h2>
            <p>
                Neuroscience proves that the best way to capture people’s attention, is to bake information into their memories, and forge close, personal bonds. Needless to say, to effectively engage people, you must stick out from the crowd. But what’s the best way to do so? Sending your customer personalized clothing for every right moment. The best gifts are premium quality products people love to wear. So Honeypot and Sunday joined forces.
                <br><br>
                We created more than 300 talent packages filled with Honeypot branded swag. The packages include a hoodie, a beanie, socks, a tote bag, branded stickers and a raspberry pi packed in a custom-made box using their pantone colors: black and yellow. The design is a mix between Honeypot’s company branding and a stylish design people love to wear. The talent packages are distributed to all of their clients, who are successful in finding a job at one of the companies on the honeypot platform. Sunday helped build the right narrative for their customer gift campaign, because handing out clothing generates even more impact if there is a clear story attached to it.

                Worldwide talent packages
            </h2>
            <p>
                Despite Honeypot comprehending the power of company swag and willing to apply it, the hassle to send out the packages was too enormous. Their number one problem was distributing the right items to the right people at the right time. Without data or any follow-up and sky-high shipping costs, their project goal was completely surpassed. With Sunday wardrobe® we have built a solution that makes shipping items becomes as easy as sending an email.
                <br><br>
                We now ship the products to our warehouse and store them there, where they are available for Honeypot upon request through the platform. By mapping out the exact strategic needs and specific demands of Honeypot, they can send out their talent packages to any address all over the world in just a few clicks on their custom-made Sunday wardrobe®’s dashboard.

                Gift campaign that screams success
            </h2>
            <p>
                An important final thought: the more you're in contact with your audience, the easier it will be for you to create an excellent customer experience. Exactly! We helped Honeypot with designing a great gifting campaign that really made an impact by determining their sales goals together and building a company fashion experience that delivers.
                <br><br>
                Creating products that their clients will actually love to wear and use, ensures that objectives are exceeded. Next to that the cooperation went excellent. We worked together on packaging that tells the story about the reason clients receive this gift. This way we can reinforce customer behavior that’s positive for your sales team. The perfect example of well-chosen quality products is that Honeypot's employees also love to wear the fashion collection. Their newly transformed ambassadors' reactions were exclusively very positive!
