                I-mens: a Belgian organization that offers home assistance in Flanders and Brussels.
            </p>
            <p>
                I-mens' goal is to bring all care to people's homes, so that they can continue to live as independently as possible in their own, familiar surroundings. They were founded 2 years ago from a fusion of six different home care organizations from Flanders and Brussels. Even though they are active in 70 places and have 15.000 employees, they come out as a new brand. Getting your brand into the world is the first rule to generate more leads. So the biggest challenge for I-mens was creating brand awareness. 
                <br><br>
                There are many ways to increase I-mens' brand awareness, but most of them rely on short term expensive media bursts. Together we believe in the power of company fashion to build a community based on the necessary quality. It is therefore a quiet dream of I-mens' CEO to have their own company fashion collection in addition to their work clothes. Because if you want to create long term continuous brand awareness, there should be as much company fashion in the market as possible.

            <h2>
                Don't forget your personalized wearables
            </h2>
            <p>
                After our first conversation, there was an immediate click. Not to quote some clich√©, but our customers drive our business, which is why we at Sunday think it's important to find ways to continuously show them we care by staying connected and listening. Not only did we become a partner in trust, I-mens had a number of quality requirements, we could meet without any hesitation. For example the production had to be in a sustainable way within Europe, however that's a standard procedure with us. The first order with us was marked by 15.000 mouth masks.
                <br><br>
                After their first order, they were totally convinced of the quality of services we offer. Not only were 15.000 mouth masks ordered again, I-mens wanted to continue building their brand through new products. Next in line of their I-mens collection: custom made backpacks. We produced 15.000 qualitative backpacks that are made in an ecological, ethical and sustainable way. The backpack is 100% cotton made in custom grey with the I-mens' logo embroidered in their pantone color. Not only do we make multiple decoration techniques possible, the backpack also has a power bank connection so any laptop or smartphone can be charged even when their employees are on the road.
                <br><br>
                What's still missing? Wearables. Yes! We designed 15.000 hoodies not only 100% on-brand, but also 100% on-trend. As our design team creates the items from scratch, our hoodies can go from regular fitted to oversized or even to a hoodie with rolled-up sleeves. I-mens loved the first design we made of their custom hoodie in off-white color. As we offer decoration techniques that are only available in the fashion industry, we added personalized tapes to the sleeves in the same pantone color as the zipper. And as a matching wearable, we created 15.000 neckwarmers in the same off-white color. Challenge done right!                
            </p>

        <div class="container">
            <h2>
                The future is assured
            </h2>
            <p>
                Talking about a surprise: the employees of I-mens' received the hoodie and buff on their doorstep! If we can say so ourselves, the collection strikes the perfect balance between I-mens' brand identity and the trends that matter to its key stakeholders. Resulting in not only blazingly enthusiastic responses from their employees, but even from customers, stakeholders and other home care organizations. 
                <br><br>
                If you do it right, and right is how I-mens did it, people will keep wearing your brand for years, with no extra cost. Company fashion is a great investment, I-mens told us because their brand will be seen by thousands of people for every hoodie, buff or mouth mask worn. Not to mention the impact on social media.
                <br><br>
                Next to having branded cars, the solid base of I-mens' brand awareness strategy is company fashion. A strategy Sunday loves to help build on!
