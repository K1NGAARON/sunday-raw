                Televic: seven decades of technological innovation
            </p>
            <p>
                Founded in 1946 as a Belgian manufacturer of professional radio systems, Televic is now an international leader in high-end communication systems across many different markets. They are supplying high-tech and high-quality communication systems for specific markets such as healthcare, education, the railway industry and the conference market. Televic wanted an additional boost for further worldwide growth and for strengthening its leading role in the sector.  
                <br><br>
                In 2023, Ambassador Marketing is the key to successfully reaching your target audience in the most authentic, credible and trusted way possible. And what better way then to be out there again!  Since brand awareness is one of the main targets of Televic, attending fairs and events is one way to go. Strategy Marketing Manager Julie Smissaerts agrees: 
                <br><br>
                “While we already had a collaboration with Sunday for branded tote bags, it was the invitation to OM Conference that won us over. Sunday’s rebranding stood out in such a way that we were amazed to see your booth while wearing the Sunday socks we received. That, of course, builds confidence that you guys are experts. That’s when we knew we wanted to collaborate and find a nice angle for our fairs and events by expanding our brand with company fashion.”

            <h2>
                Business shirts are always a winner
            </h2>
            <p>
                Since the world has opened her doors again, events and fairs are happening again! Businesses dare to think ahead to the Post-Covid Era, they are continuing to do business, networking offline again and dealing creatively with the current situation. A successful exhibition booth goes hand in hand with style, that’s why smart clothing for the entire team to gain visibility and recognition was a must. For the entire sales team of Televic we created stylish, white business shirts. Even though we can go out-of-the-box with the design, we created classic business shirts that completely fits Televic’s brand image.
                <br><br>
                In addition to visibility, they wanted to create unity at the different sales booths at fairs and events. Next to the business shirts, Televic provided bright green sneakers to make their outfit whole. Next to the classic apparel like business shirts, we designed and produced tote bags and caps. For these pieces, Televic wanted a different approach by presenting itself more as a thought leader. With the slogan: "I'm an expert" imprinted on the caps, they succeeded in triggering their target audience. Even though they found their flashing pantone green a big challenge to make it look fashionable, we only used it in the details of their clothing to make sure the perfect match was found with both their brand guidelines and relevant trends.
                <br><br>
                “Sunday offers a very wide range, so you are both able to please our classic or more traditional people with business shirts, knitted sweaters and polo shirts. While young hipsters are certainly not caught short either with socks, sweaters and caps. In short, there are items and designs for everyone and every company,” continues Julie.

                Flashing success
            </h2>
            <p>
                Showing appreciation for all the work your employees do, comes with a gift in the same quality. At Sunday we promised Televic sustainable and ethical clothing, produced in Europe with the highest quality. So that’s what we delivered. As they wanted to be trendier and more modest following their new brand guidelines, we created true pieces of fashion. And most importantly created clothing that their employees love to wear.
                <br><br>
                According to Televic we succeeded with flying colors. "The cooperation went very smoothly, our Sunday account really kept his finger on the pulse. Exactly because the deadline was tight. Despite the fact that we have international offices, it was still possible to have samples of the business shirts fitted by all employees. And I haven't even talked about the very good quality of the products we received."
                <br><br>
                With other companies trying to impress future talents with a pen, Televic really wants to stand out from the crowd with their company fashion. As it is clear that the additional goal of the company is attracting more talent. The wearable designs are truly an asset to turn your employees into real ambassadors. Televic is a great example to show that company fashion can lead to more positive results than just the goals for which it was intended. Think about boosting your company culture, your image and even attracting new people.
