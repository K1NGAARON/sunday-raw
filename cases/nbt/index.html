                NBT (Next Big Thing) firmly believes in the individuals behind groundbreaking ideas. As a prominent venture studio and technology provider, they propel the world towards sensor-based innovation for a sustainable future by co-founding deep tech ventures with aspiring founders to make a real-world impact. If you possess a brilliant idea and seek an incubator that will nurture your startup's successful growth, your search ends here.
                <br><br>
                Now, you may wonder what a venture studio has to do with branded merchandise. While NBT has always provided clothing for its employees, they came up with the ingenious idea of organizing giveaways for different stakeholder groups to gain brand recognition.

            <h2>
                Elevating Onboarding and Celebrations through NBT Clothing
            </h2>
            <p>
                The apparel serves multiple purposes. For instance, new employees receive a welcome box filled with NBT-branded clothing, instantly making them feel warmly embraced by the company and significantly elevating their onboarding experience.
                <br><br>
                Also, long-standing employees occasionally receive more trendy pieces of clothing. Wearing clothing bearing the company's branding creates a stronger bond between the employees and the brand. NBT holds two major parties each year, one at the beginning of summer and another during Christmas. On these occasions, the company surprises its employees with event-themed merchandise, resulting in nothing but joy and delight.
                <br><br>
                Marc, Senior Brand Manager at NBT, explains that this strategy also contributes to their employer branding. Demonstrating a strong and fun team is an asset for any company, attracting applicants who are more likely to be drawn to the organization.
                <br><br>
                Furthermore, NBT occasionally gives away merchandise at trade shows and other industry events to generate leads. High-quality merchandise serves as an excellent conversation starter and facilitates data collection from visitors. Additionally, when the team is dressed in premium merchandise, they are easily recognizable, which greatly aids brand awareness.

        <div class="container">
            <h2>
                Not just a logo
            </h2>
            <p>
                The collaboration between Sunday and NBT began after the company had the opportunity to see and feel some samples in their office. "The quality impressed us, which was a crucial factor," said Marc. Moreover, the creative freedom provided by Sunday was a significant advantage. Since the clothing is custom-made, it offers much more than simply placing a logo.
                <br><br>
                Numerous collections have been created, featuring items such as t-shirts, caps, tote bags, sliders, and socks. The main requirements are that the clothes look fantastic and everyone feels comfortable wearing them. NBT's design department worked closely with Sunday's team, ensuring that the collection was highly wearable and that individuals felt at ease in the clothing.
                <br><br>
                The initial collections prominently showcased the NBT logo, enhancing brand visibility. However, the company recently introduced a collection with a few items that subtly display the NBT logo (e.g., a black shirt with black embroidery). The designs are continuously evolving, but the corporate identity, characterized by its signature red color, remains essential.

                NBT enjoys working with Sunday due to the personalized contact and unwavering commitment. "There is always a dedicated point of contact who coordinates various matters, which is rare in this field. We also appreciate Sunday's proactive approach to feedback, effectively incorporating it into their work. We are happy with our collaboration and eagerly anticipate future ones!"
