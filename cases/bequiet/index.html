            <h2>
                Exceptionally quiet operation
            </h2>
            <p>
                be quiet! lives up to its name: 20 years of experience in product development makes be quiet! products amongst the most silent ones on the market. If you are a pc enthusiast, gamer or designer you probably know the brand very well!
                <br><br>
                The high-quality products are very well received by the target audience. So well that anyone who buys a product from be quiet! also effectively remains a customer, and even becomes a fan of the brand.
                <br><br>
                In this way, the company managed to build a real community around its brand. 
            </p>

            <h2>
                Building the strongest communities
            </h2>
            <p>
                The be quiet team offers their products through online shops and retailers, online and offline. Of course, to maintain and grow a community, a brand needs to take care of its ambassadors.
                <br><br>
                “We have a really strong community and wanted to make some merch that they would love to wear” says Katharina Kriehn, Marketing Manager UK & Channel DACH at be quiet!. 
                <br><br>
                Besides influencer campaigns the company also organizes give away contests for their fan base. Thanks to these giveaways, fans can get their hands on a quality garment in be quiet! branding. These get very well perceived, especially on special occasions like Christmas or Easter.
                <br><br>
                The first collaboration between be quiet! and Sunday came about when they were looking for a partner who could create a Christmas jumper in their branding. It has since become 1 of the community's most requested and loved products, which means we will now already be at the 5th edition this year. They are becoming real collectible items, so to speak!
                <br><br>
                The purpose of these actions is twofold: on the one hand, it creates a lot of engagement on social channels with new followers, likes, comments, ... giving the brand extra visibility. On the other hand, it is a way of giving something back to the community.
                <br><br>
                “We want to show people we work with that we love working with them by giving them a limited edition present.”
                <br><br>
                Not only influencers were very happy with the branded merchandise, everyone seemed to love it why it also got handed out to B2B customers and even employees!
                <br><br>
                Christmas jumpers weren't the only popular item, no fewer than 7 different clothing items were created in be quiet branding: a 3 panel hoodie, black on black shirt, scarf and beanie (who got used as Christmas gifts), extremely popular sweatpants, long sleeves and sliders.
            </p>
        </div>

        <img src="/cases/bequiet/img/image1.jpg" alt="">

        <div class="container">
            <h2>
                Premium designs that fit the audience
            </h2>
            <p>
                In terms of clothing design, the company has high standards. Since they also work with super premium products themselves, this level of quality must also be further expressed in their merchandise. The design has to be premium and of high quality and wearable, so nothing too crazy. 
                <br><br>
                Be quiet! has different colors than most companies in their industry which is an opportunity to really stand out. The use of the colors (black, orange and white) therefore got used wisely. The designs also had to be appealing to a young audience and influencers, but also needed to fit with the culture of the company and be very recognizable as the be quiet! brand.
                <br><br>
                Another way to use the merchandise in a smart way? The be quiet! video and social media teams wear the clothing a lot! Especially when they create new content like video's, so the merchandise can be seen in it. It's a great way to show people that you are really a team. Talking about employer branding!
