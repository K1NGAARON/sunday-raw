            <p>
                At Sunday, we believe that success in the fashion industry goes beyond profit and encompasses the responsibility to make a positive impact on society and the environment. We are committed to practicing Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in all aspects of our business operations. Our CSR initiatives aim to promote sustainability, ethical practices, and social welfare, while inspiring positive change within the fashion industry.
                <br><br>
                <span class="bold">Sustainable Sourcing and Supply Chain:</span>
                <br>
                We recognize the environmental and social impact of the fashion industry's supply chain. Sunday is dedicated to ensuring transparency and sustainability throughout our sourcing process. We strive to collaborate with suppliers who uphold ethical practices, prioritize fair trade principles, and minimize their carbon footprint. We also prioritize the use of eco-friendly materials and promote recycling and upcycling within our production processes.

            <p>
                One of the main challenges our customers face is handling the logistics of the merchandise. The industry standard is that once the products are made, the supplier's job is done. We beg to differ. That's why we've developed our WardrobeTM platform. A virtual closet that keeps an overview of your merch including real time stock levels and that helps our customers ship their merchandise globally in a couple of clicks. While we do the hard fulfillment work behind the scenes.
                <br><br>
                Our customer is at the center of our business. That's why it is our only goal to make their lives better by:

                    Consistently investing in processes and software solutions that make their lives easier (WardrobeTM, Realistic 3D designs, Remote size gathering tool, ...) Helping and advising our clients during the whole process on a personal level.

            In order to keep as much textiles out of the landfill as possible, it's important for each of us to do our part. One of the ways to put that plan into action is through the 3 R's of waste management. With Sunday, we guide both our customers and suppliers on how to use resources as efficiently as possible and thus reduce waste.
