Merchandise isn't just an afterthought; it's a crucial component of your event strategy that can help you stand out, attract leads, and create lasting impressions.

                1. Start early: The 12-week timeline
            </h2>
            <p>
                Timing is everything when it comes to preparing your merchandise for a fair. Starting the process at least 12 weeks (90 days) before the event is crucial. Here’s why:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <span class="bold">Strategy phase (Weeks 1-2):</span> Begin by aligning your merchandise strategy with the overall branding and goals of the fair. This phase also involves deciding on the tiered merchandise approach, ensuring you have different levels of items for various audience segments.Work with your team to plan the best way to display these items at your booth. Remember, merchandise isn't just a giveaway; it's a key part of your booth's appeal and should be presented in a way that enhances its perceived value.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="bold">Design phase (Weeks 3-4):</span> Work closely with your merchandise partner to brainstorm and finalize designs that are consistent with your booth, brand colors, and messaging. Make sure to invest time in the right briefing as it will speed up the total design process.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="bold">Production and delivery (Weeks 5-12):</span> Once designs are approved, move into production. Give your supplier ample time to produce high-quality items without rushing, which could lead to compromises in quality. If you start late, you risk ending up with poor-quality items that don't align with your brand, and you might also incur higher costs. During this period, finalize logistics and ensure that all merchandise arrives at the fair on time.

                2. Implementing a tiered merchandise strategy
            </h2>
            <p>
                One common mistake many companies make is distributing the same merchandise to everyone, regardless of their potential value as a lead. To avoid this, adopt a tiered merchandise strategy:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <span class="bold">Tier 1: Low-Cost, High-Volume Items</span>
                    <br>
                    These items are for general visitors and are designed to grab attention and increase brand visibility across the fair. Examples include tote bags, socks, notebooks, and pens. Tote bags, in particular, are highly effective as they are visible throughout the event, leading people to your booth.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="bold">Tier 2: Mid-Range, Impactful Items</span>
                    <br>
                    Reserved for promising prospects, these items should be more unique and higher in perceived value, typically costing between €10 and €20. Think of these as rewards for meaningful interactions with potential leads. Examples include stylish t-shirts, caps, or insulated tea bottles. The key here is to ensure that these items are given selectively, enhancing the personal connection with the recipient.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="bold">Tier 3: High-End, Exclusive Items</span>
                    <br>
                    These are for your top-tier prospects and existing customers—those who can significantly impact your business. These items should be of premium quality, such as high-end backpacks, jackets, or luxury branded items, costing €50 to €100 or more. Limited availability of these items adds to their exclusivity and value. Make sure to also pay attention to packaging, great packaging enhances the experience.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="italic">
                <span class="bold">Pro tip:</span> Estimate quantities carefully based on the size and nature of the fair. For example, if you expect 10,000 visitors, you might prepare 1,000 low-tier items, 200 mid-tier items, and 20 to 50 top-tier items.

                3. Consistency is king: Align your merchandise with your brand
            </h2>
            <p>
                Your merchandise should never feel like an afterthought; it must be an integral part of your overall branding strategy. Here’s how to ensure consistency:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <span class="bold">Color and design consistency:</span> Match the color scheme of your merchandise with your booth design and overall brand identity. If your booth uses red, black, and white, make sure your merchandise reflects these colors. This visual consistency not only reinforces your brand but also helps guide attendees back to your booth when they see others using your items. Here are some collection designs as inspiration.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="bold">Display matters:</span> Don’t just throw your merchandise in a box next to your booth. Create a mini shop-in-shop display, with items neatly presented on racks, shelves, or tables. This enhances the perceived value of the merchandise and attracts more visitors to your booth.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="bold">Team attire:</span> Your team should be easily recognizable and dressed in merchandise that reflects your brand. Whether it’s business shirts, casual streetwear, or something else, ensure that it aligns with your brand story and the atmosphere of your booth. The right attire not only makes your team approachable but also reinforces the brand message you’re conveying.

                The way you display your merchandise can significantly impact its perceived value and your booth’s attractiveness. Here are some tips:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <span class="bold">Create a retail experience:</span> Arrange your merchandise as you would in a retail store. Use clothing racks, mannequins, or neatly folded displays to make the items more appealing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="bold">Highlight top-tier items:</span> For your most exclusive items, consider a special display area that draws attention and emphasizes their value. This could include spotlighting, glass cases, or dedicated display stands.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="bold">Interactive displays:</span> Encourage visitors to interact with the merchandise. For example, have a “try it on” station for apparel or a demo area for tech gadgets. The more engaged visitors are, the more likely they are to remember your brand.

                    <span class="bold">Post-event analysis:</span> After the event, conduct a thorough analysis of how your merchandise performed. Go through the lead list with your sales team to identify top prospects and brand ambassadors. Use this data to refine your strategy for future events.
