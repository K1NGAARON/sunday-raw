                1. Understanding the Importance of New hire Welcome Gifts
            </h2>
            <p>
                Welcome gifts serve as a tangible expression of the company's values and culture. They play a critical role in the onboarding process by making new employees feel acknowledged and valued. A thoughtfully chosen welcome gift can boost morale, increase job satisfaction, and significantly impact a new hire's perception of the company. It's not just about the items themselves but the message they convey: "You are an important part of our team."
                <br><br>
                Techjury notes that as much as 20% of staff turnover occurs within the first 45 days of employment, underscoring the critical importance of the initial period of employment in retention strategies: <a href="https://techjury.net/blog/onboarding-statistics/" target="_blank">33 Startling Employee Onboarding Statistics to Know in 2024​</a>​.

                2. The Evolution of Welcome Gifts
            </h2>
            <p>
                In today's workplace, welcoming new teammates with a gift has taken on a whole new meaning, especially when it comes to something as personal as apparel. Think about it—not just any pen or notebook, but something you actually wear. It's 2025, and we're all about making people feel like they're part of something bigger, right from the get-go.
                <br><br>
                Apparel isn't just clothing; it's like wrapping someone in the team spirit. It's a way of saying, "Hey, you're one of us now." When a new hire gets a piece of clothing that reflects the company's vibe, it's more than a welcome gift. It's a symbol, a piece of the puzzle that is our unique workplace culture. It says, "We're glad you're here, and we can't wait to see how you contribute to our story."
                <br><br>
                This choice of gift is a shout-out to the blend of personalities and talents in our team. It doesn't matter if you're dialing in from your home office or grabbing coffee in the break room; wearing something that connects you to the team makes the distance fade away. It's about creating a feeling of togetherness, even if we're not all in the same place.
                <br><br>
                So, why do we lean towards apparel in our welcome gifts? Because it's a warm hug in the form of a <a href="/catalog/t-shirts/">t-shirt</a> or <a href="/catalog/hoodies/">hoodie</a>. It's our way of weaving the individual threads of our team into a stronger, more vibrant tapestry. It's about making everyone feel right at home, part of the family, from day one. That's the heart of it—building a place where everyone feels they belong, supported by the very fabric of what we wear. It's pretty cool when you think about it.

                3. Key Considerations for Choosing Welcome Gifts
            </h2>
            <p>
                <span class="bold">Dedicated: </span>You only get 1 shot at a first impression, make sure the welcome box matches your company's culture, values and quality level. Some companies often make the mistake of just throwing some leftover gifts from marketing events in a flimsy totebag and present this as the welcome gift. Sadly this gives the new employee the impression that they are only worth some leftovers. Make sure your welcome kit is a dedicated and well thought through experience.
                <br><br>
                <span class="bold">Useful: </span>Put items in the box that are actually useful for the new hire. Everybody has plenty of mints, stressballs & charger cables. Put items in there that bring the new hires into the company culture and items that could be practical on their first work day. Later in this article we'll go through a list of great items for your welcome kits.
                <br><br>
                <span class="bold">Quality over quantity: </span>It is a lot better to give 1 or 2 great items in a nice experience than 10 small items just thrown together. With a good quality <a href="/catalog/backpacks/">fully branded backpack</a> or <a href="/catalog/hoodies/">hoodie</a> the new hire will feel way more valued than 10 little promotional gadgets
            </p>
            <img src="./img/image-3.jpg" alt="">
            <p>
                <span class="bold">Sustainability: </span>With a growing emphasis on environmental responsibility, choosing eco-friendly gifts can reflect your company's commitment to sustainability. They care how and where everything is produced. Choose for reliable partners with transparency over their supply chain.
                <br><br>
                <span class="bold">Presentation: </span>The way a gift is presented can significantly enhance its impact. Consider packaging and the delivery method as part of the gift-giving experience. Go for a custom branded box to really enhance the gifting experience. If you want to go above and beyond ad a personalized note and maybe even some printed silk paper.
                <br><br>
                <span class="bold">Logistics: </span>The times where every new hire comes to the office are over. Look for a partner that can handle global logistics for you if you want to get a welcome box delivered anywhere in the world. <a href="/platform/">We can help you with our Sunday Wardrobe platform1</a>. Make sure the receiving experience is also great, nobody likes to pay duties invoice before they receive.

            </h2>

                First off, it's important to understand that welcome gifts are more than just niceties; they're a tangible way to express your company culture and values.

                <span class="bold">Define the Objective:</span> Understand what you want to achieve with the welcome gifts. Is it purely about making a good first impression, or do you want to instill certain values from the get-go?

                <span class="bold">Determine the Budget Range:</span> Based on your company's financial health and the significance you place on onboarding, decide on a reasonable range you're willing to spend per new hire. For example: between €75 - €100 for every new hire.

                <span class="bold">Factor in Frequency:</span> Consider how often you'll be welcoming new hires. A high turnover rate or rapid expansion could mean a significant annual investment in welcome gifts. We'll be welcoming 15 new hires every month, so the yearly forecast is around 180 boxes.

                6. Advanced tips to increase the impact of your employee welcome gifts 
            </h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Gather Information: Use pre-employment surveys to gather information about new hires' preferences, dietary restrictions, and hobbies to personalize gifts effectively.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Manage your employee welcome kits through an <a href="https://ardo-internal.shop.teamsunday.com/" target="_blank">internal employee webshop</a>, this improves your internal administration flow and gives the new hire the flexibility to even choose the items they prefer.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Include a Personal Note: A handwritten note from the team or leadership adds a personal touch that can make the welcome gift feel even more special. Through our Wardrobe platform you can also add personalized notes for every new hire.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Timing is Key: Present the welcome gift on their first day or during their first week to make a strong initial impact. Some companies even send out the welcome box the week before the new hire starts.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Feedback Loop: Encourage feedback on welcome gifts to continuously improve and adapt your approach based on what new employees find valuable.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add nudges to share this box on social media on the packaging of the box. Every social share is a new boost to your employer brand.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Find a partner that you can trust 100% in product, delivery & service. The welcome box is a crucial step in the new employee journey and should be handled with utmost care.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Go the extra mile in brand, if you are already investing in welcome kits, don't settle for just your logo on a product. Take the time to really create products that 100% match your brand and style. The more unique the design, the better it will work to connect the new hires with your culture.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Never forget about the already loyal employees, when starting with employee welcome kits, the current team often feels left behind. You can counter this by giving the welcome kit also on their work anniversary. This way the whole company can rep the employer brand with the first year and it's a fun present for their engagement.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Take good pictures. New hire or team foto's with people wearing the branded merch is great for marketing purposes, take the time to share them.
                </li>

                                To ensure your welcome gifts accurately reflect your company culture, start by identifying your company's core values and mission. Choose items that align with these principles. For example, if sustainability is a key part of your culture, opt for eco-friendly gifts like reusable water bottles or items made from recycled materials. Incorporating your company's branding in a tasteful and meaningful way can also reinforce your culture.

                                Personalizing welcome gifts while respecting privacy can be achieved by using pre-employment surveys to ask new hires about their preferences, hobbies, or interests in a non-intrusive manner. Alternatively, you can offer a selection of gifts and allow them to choose their preferred item through an internal webshop. Including a personal note from their team or manager can add a touch of warmth without needing to know intimate details about the new employee.

Providing tracking information to new hires can also enhance the experience by building anticipation and ensuring they know when to expect their welcome gift.
