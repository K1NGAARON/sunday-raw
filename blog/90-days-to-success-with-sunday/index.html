                1. Project Kickoff and Briefing
            </h2>
            <p>
                <span class="bold">Duration: 15 minutes to 1 hour</span>
                <br><br>
                <span class="bold">Key Players:</span> Department Head, Project Manager, and occasionally the Lead Designer or Head of Brand
                <br><br>
                <span class="bold">Overview:</span>
                <br>
                The kickoff meeting is the foundation of the entire merchandise project. This initial discussion is crucial for aligning all stakeholders and setting clear expectations for the project. Depending on the complexity of your project, this meeting could be a quick 15-minute conversation or an in-depth discussion lasting up to an hour.
                <br><br>
                During this meeting, we delve into the purpose of the campaignâ€”whether it's for onboarding, an event, or a long-term initiative. Understanding the goals allows us to tailor the project to meet your specific needs. We'll also discuss the scale of the project, which directly impacts budgeting, production timelines, and design possibilities. Having both the department head and the project manager involved ensures that strategic goals and practical execution are aligned from the start.
                <br><br>
                <span class="bold">Typical Concerns:</span>
                <br>
                Clients often worry about timelines and the scale of the project. Whether you're targeting 100 people or 10,000, the approach and logistics will differ significantly. This is the stage where we address these concerns, setting realistic expectations and planning accordingly.

                2. Practical Details and Planning
            </h2>
            <p>
                <span class="bold">Duration:</span> Typically immediate, following the kickoff meeting
                <br><br>
                <span class="bold">Overview:</span> After the kickoff, we move into gathering the practical details that will shape the project. This includes confirming the quantity of items needed, the budget per person, and the timeline for the campaign. It's also essential to establish who will be involved in the decision-making process.
                <br><br>
                One of the key aspects we address is distribution. Clients often focus heavily on the products themselves but overlook the complexity of distribution, especially at scale. For example, handing out 1,000 t-shirts requires careful planning around size collection, distribution methods, and tracking who has received their items. Discussing these logistics early on prevents complications later and ensures that the project runs smoothly.
                <br><br> 
                <span class="bold">Templates and Tools:</span>
                <br>
                While many clients come prepared with these details, we provide templates to help if needed. These templates ensure that all necessary information is gathered efficiently, avoiding delays and misunderstandings.

            <h2>
                3. Product Selection
            </h2>
            <p>
                <span class="bold">Duration: </span>1 day
                <br><br>
                <span class="bold">Overview:</span> Product selection is where creativity meets strategy. Based on the project's goals, target audience, and budget, we help you <a href="/catalog/">choose the best products</a> to achieve your objectives. This could range from simple items like tote bags to more complex, high-end products like <a href="/catalog/jackets/">custom jackets</a> or sneakers.
                <br><br>
                Our team takes a few days to brainstorm and gather suggestions that align with your needs. If you already have specific products in mind, we can expedite this process. Alternatively, we can leverage our R&D department to suggest innovative products you may not have considered.
                <br><br>
                <span class="bold">Samples:</span> We highly recommend requesting samples, as they allow you to experience the quality firsthand. Samples can add about a week to the timeline but are invaluable for ensuring that stakeholders are confident in the product choices. This step can be particularly helpful in convincing others within your organization of the value of the project.
                <br><br>
                <span class="bold">Considerations:</span> Important factors during product selection include whether to offer size options, which can increase complexity but significantly improve user satisfaction. Additionally, consider if you want to offer choices to recipients, as giving people the ability to choose their item often results in higher engagement and appreciation.

                4. Design Process
            </h2>
            <p>
                <span class="bold">Duration:</span> 1 to 2 weeks
                <br>
                <span class="bold">Overview:</span> The design process is where your brand's identity comes to life through merchandise. To do this effectively, we need detailed brand guidelines, including logos, Pantone colors, and any specific design elements that need to be incorporated. You can also read our blogpost on creating the perfect design briefing.
                <br><br>
                <span class="bold">Factors Affecting Timeline:</span> The design phase typically takes 1 to 2 weeks, but this can vary based on several factors. For example, if the project is being developed during a peak period like the holiday season, timelines may extend slightly. Another key factor is the number of stakeholders involved in the approval process. More decision-makers can mean longer timelines, so it's important to identify who needs to sign off on designs early on.
                <br><br>
                <span class="bold">Handling Changes:</span> If significant changes are needed after the initial design, we enter a more iterative process. Our team works closely with you to refine the designs, ensuring that we fully capture your vision while staying within the project's scope.

                <span class="bold">Duration:</span> Typically 1 to 2 feedback rounds, taking a few days to 2 weeks
                <br>
                <span class="bold">Overview:</span> Once the initial designs are ready, we enter the feedback phase. Our goal is to be as close to perfect as possible in the first round, but we recognize that adjustments may be needed. The feedback process is crucial for fine-tuning the designs to meet your exact expectations.
                <br><br>
                <span class="bold">Efficient Feedback:</span> To keep the project moving, we encourage clients to gather and consolidate feedback from all stakeholders before submitting it to us. This helps avoid extended feedback rounds and keeps the timeline on track. Most projects are finalized with just one round of feedback, though occasionally a second round may be necessary.
                <br><br>
                <span class="bold">Common Feedback Types:</span> Typical feedback includes preferences on logo size and positioning, color adjustments, and choosing between different design versions. The sooner we receive clear and concise feedback, the quicker we can move forward.

We provide detailed 3D models of the merchandise, giving you a realistic preview of the final product. This visualization is critical for ensuring that all stakeholders are satisfied before moving into production.

                <span class="bold">Managing Production Time:</span> Large orders or projects with intricate details may take longer to produce. Additionally, if production is scheduled during peak seasons, such as leading up to Christmas, timelines may extend slightly. However, our team is proactive in managing these factors and will communicate any potential delays well in advance.
                <br><br>
                <span class="bold">Production Delays:</span> In the rare event of a production delay, we maintain transparency and work with you to minimize the impact. Whether it's delivering in batches or adjusting timelines for less critical items, we strive to meet your project's deadlines without compromising quality.
