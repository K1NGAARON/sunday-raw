                Managing logistics in-house might seem like a cost-effective solution for handling your merchandise. However, for many companies, especially those not specialized in logistics, it can turn into an overwhelming and inefficient process. What seems simple—storing, picking, packing, and shipping merchandise—quickly becomes a time-consuming, error-prone, and costly endeavor that eats into your team's time and resources.
                <br><br>
                At Sunday, we've seen firsthand how companies that try to manage merchandise logistics internally end up facing hidden costs and headaches that ultimately derail the very purpose of branded merchandise. Here's why outsourcing your logistics to a platform like Sunday isn't just easier—it's actually much cheaper and far more effective. If you want to see our platform in action, request a demo here.

                The hidden costs of in-house logistics
            </h2>
            <p>
                Managing logistics in-house comes with a lot more than meets the eye. Let's break down the key challenges:
            </p>

            <h3>
                1. Warehousing costs and inefficiencies
            </h3>
            <p>
                When you handle merchandise storage in-house, you need to factor in warehousing costs, both in terms of space and organization. Proper storage isn't just about stacking items in a closet. You need clear, organized, and pickable storage to avoid wasted time searching for items, tracking inventory levels, and preventing stock issues. Without a streamlined process, your team could spend hours managing and updating inventory in an Excel file, and still miss key details like low stock levels or incorrect orders.
            </p>
            <img src="./img/image-2.png" alt="">
            <p class="italic">
                Transparent stock overview for every variant
            </p>
            <p>
                At Sunday, we offer warm and secure warehousing with a system that tracks stock levels, making your inventory management seamless and headache-free. No more forgotten boxes or misplaced items.
            </p>

            <h3>
                2. Time-consuming picking and packing
            </h3>
            <p>
                Picking and packing might sound simple, but when you're dealing with multiple SKUs, varying sizes, and custom notes, things get complicated. Your team will spend unnecessary time searching for the right products, assembling boxes, creating shipping labels, and handling packing material. Worse yet, if something's out of stock or mislabeled, the whole process can grind to a halt.
                <br><br>
                Our platform automates and streamlines this entire process, ensuring the right items are picked and packed in record time without human error. The best part? We ship every day, meaning no delays, and your packages go out as soon as you request them.
            </p>

            <h3>
                3. Data management and tracking
            </h3>
            <p>
                Manually tracking shipments, updating stock levels, and managing data through spreadsheets is a recipe for mistakes. Not only do you risk losing valuable time chasing down tracking numbers, but it's also easy to overlook items that weren't delivered or packages that went missing. Mistakes with addresses, international shipping documentation, or wrong SKUs lead to costly delays and lost opportunities.

                Sunday integrates all logistics data into one transparent platform, so you always know what's going out, when, and where it's headed. No more manual tracking or updating spreadsheets. It's all done for you.
            </p>

            <h3>
                4. The risks of international shipping
            </h3>
            <p>
                Shipping globally? Brace yourself for a flood of paperwork, regulations, and potential errors. From customs declarations to handling country-specific documentation, international shipments are fraught with potential pitfalls. A small mistake like an incorrect shipping label or missing customs form can delay your package for weeks or send it back, costing you money and frustrating both your team and your customers.
            </p>

            <p>
                With Sunday, we take care of all customs documentation, making international shipping as easy as domestic. Plus, we handle every detail—ensuring your merchandise arrives quickly and without a hitch.

            <h2>
                Scaling and flexibility: ready for anything
            </h2>
            <p>
                In-house logistics rarely scale smoothly. When you're shipping one or two packages a day, it's manageable. But what happens when you have a huge campaign or a holiday rush, and suddenly you're faced with hundreds or thousands of packages? Finding temporary staff, ensuring everyone knows the system, and avoiding mistakes becomes a logistical nightmare.
                <br><br>
                Sunday scales with you. Whether you need to send out a handful of packages or hundreds, we've got you covered—without needing to hire extra hands or train new people. Plus, we can help manage inbound shipments, taking care of inventory intake and ensuring it's all tracked seamlessly in our system.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="container">
            <h2>
                Mistakes and the cost of doing it wrong
            </h2>
            <p>
                Let's face it: mistakes happen. Whether it's sending the wrong size, forgetting to include an item, or having a typo in the address, in-house logistics often lead to errors that result in unhappy customers and wasted time fixing problems. Returns, exchanges, and re-shipping eat into your resources and tarnish the experience you're trying to provide with your merchandise.
            </p>
            <img src="./img/image-5.png" alt="">
            <p>
                By outsourcing to Sunday, you reduce human error. Our system ensures everything is picked, packed, and shipped correctly the first time, with full address verification and tracking. We handle returns and restocking, too—so you don't have to.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="container">
            <h2>
                The opportunity cost of managing it all yourself
            </h2>
            <p>
                For most businesses, managing merchandise logistics isn't a core focus. It's something extra—a task that pulls your team away from their primary roles and takes time away from more important initiatives, like marketing or HR campaigns. When you DIY your logistics, the real cost comes in lost opportunities. Your team spends their time packing boxes instead of working on tasks that directly contribute to business growth.
                <br><br>
                By outsourcing to Sunday, you can stay focused on what matters—building brand recognition, running campaigns, and hitting your targets—while we handle all the logistics in the background.
